    <inlineHelpText>This indicates if a field has been set as required as part of its base definition. Note that it is also possible for a field to be marked as required on individual page layouts or dynamic forms; so just because a field isn&apos;t marked as required here, it may still be required in a specific context. (And of course tools such as validation rules can also be used to enforce the presence of a value.)</inlineHelpText>
